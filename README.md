### Hello, World!

A forward-thinking and innovative Lead Blockchain Engineer, my journey in the blockchain realm commenced during my tenure at New York University, where I pursued a Master of Science in Computer Science. My academic pursuits laid a solid foundation in blockchain technology, paving the way for a career that blends technical prowess with strategic insight. Currently, at Telcoin in Santa Monica, CA, I am at the forefront of developing and managing on-chain infrastructure across Ethereum, Polygon, and the developmental Telcoin Network, overseeing assets with a total locked value (TLV) of $15M USD. My role involves spearheading the integration of blockchain technologies, coordinating closely with security and finance departments, and leading the blockchain department towards innovative solutions in smart contract development and cross-chain functionalities.

In the near future, I am set to embark on an exciting venture with OMNI, focusing on smart contract development for the burgeoning Telcoin Network. This opportunity will see me working in tandem with the Telcoin Association Operations, leveraging my expertise to contribute to the network's growth and the broader adoption of blockchain technology. My work will involve crafting sophisticated smart contracts and playing a pivotal role in enhancing the network's capabilities, ensuring it meets the evolving needs of the digital economy.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I am deeply engaged in the DeFi space during my free time, actively participating in staking, voting in governance, and running my own blockchain validator nodes. This engagement not only showcases my passion for blockchain technology but also provides me with a hands-on understanding of the latest trends and innovations in the DeFi sector. My comprehensive experience and active participation in the blockchain community underscore my commitment to advancing the field and contributing to its sustainable growth.
