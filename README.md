## Hello, World! I'm Amir!

My first passion was chemistry — I was fascinated by how simple elements could combine into something entirely new. That fascination led me to study Chemical Engineering, where I learned how small interactions can scale into complex, balanced systems.

Years later, I found myself drawn to blockchain for almost the same reason. It felt like rediscovering that same sense of structure and discovery — a world built on first principles, where math replaces molecules. The blockchain became my new lab.

I went on to earn my Master’s in Computer Science at NYU, bridging that analytical mindset into engineering software systems. Since then, I’ve worked across Ethereum, Polygon, and Base, designing smart contract architectures, governance frameworks, and tokenized infrastructure.

Today, I’m the Lead Smart Contract Engineer at Flip Protocol, where we’re reimagining how people interact with markets and liquidity through transparent, decentralized systems. Before that, I led blockchain development at Telcoin, helping build staking, governance, and stablecoin frameworks that connected DeFi with real-world finance.

For me, both chemistry and blockchain scratch the same itch — understanding the rules of a system deeply enough to create something new from them. I’m always excited to explore that boundary between structure and innovation.
